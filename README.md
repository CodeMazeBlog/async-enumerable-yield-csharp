## https://code-maze.com/csharp-async-enumerable-yield
<p>The support for<strong>Async Streams</strong> was one of the most exciting features that came out with .NET Core 3.0 and C# 8. This is possible with the use of IAsyncEnumerableÂ with the yield operator. In this article, we are going to explore how to take advantage of this new feature to improve our code.</p>
